# Landing Page

Project #2 for the Udacity Frontend Web Developer Nanodegree

## Introduction
This project is a multisection landing page with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page

## Requirements
* HTML should have at least 3 sections
* Build the navigation menu dynamically based on the sections of the page
* Add functionality to distinguish what section of the page is in the viewport or closest to the top
* Add functionality to scroll to sections of the page. Clicking on a navigation item to scroll to the appropriate section.

### Suggested features that were added
* Add an active state to a navigation item when its section is in the viewport
* Hide fixed navigation bar while not scrolling (It should be present on page load)
* Add a scroll to top button that's only visible when the user scrolls below the fold of the page
* Make sections collapsible
